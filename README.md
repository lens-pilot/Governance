# Governance

This repository contains the governance artifacts for the Lens Pilot.

It defines policies, decision-making processes, cohort design, reviewer expectations, and other operational rules that guide how the pilot functions.

All changes to governance documents are tracked and reviewed in this repository. Decisions are recorded explicitly to preserve institutional memory.
